Rants & Rumblings on React. Codes of some boilerplate projects, concepts and others.

#### â€ŠComponents & States

 * Everything in React is a component,  and these usually take the form of JavaScript classes.
 * A componenet should return a ```render()``` which returns HTML code
 * A component can be created by extending upon the React-Component class.
 * Importing babel is required, as React uses JSX to write markup, to transform this JSX into plain JavaScript, so that the browser can understand it.
 * ```Hello``` is a component, ```ReactDOM.render()``` method is used connect our ```Hello``` component with the entry point for the app ```(<div id="root"></div>)``` below:
  
   ```
   class Hello extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return <h1>Hello world!</h1>;
        }
    }
    ReactDOM.render(
        <Hello />, 
        document.getElementById("root")
    );
   ```
